# What is this app??

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ This is my very first "real project" based on Html, CSS and JavaScript web page development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ It is a basic game based on guess a number between 1 and 20 and it is full on web page working.

&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰To can run it, clone the repository or download the zip file and open the html file with your favorite web browser. Or, execute it with the Live server of you IDE; or you can click on the Netlify web link to use it directly on your browser:<a target="_blank" href="https://guess-my-number-vlaicu.netlify.app/" ><b>https://guess-my-number-vlaicu.netlify.app/</b>
